The files shown here are part of the development of a mini weather station integrating an ESP32 microcontroller, which is later connected to the AWS cloud for data analytics. This school project was carried out in collaboration with Aldo Vladimir and Rodrigo Castillo, professors at the Faculty of Science, UNAM, for the Digital Systems course. Some of the initial files serve as a technical-theoretical practice that students should be familiar with before they are implemented together. The aws_mqtt file contains the final version of the code implemented on the microcontroller for the subsequent connection. Any code-related discussions should be directed to ARDUINO and its creators.

## Mini Weather Station with ESP32 and AWS Integration

This repository contains files related to the development of a mini weather station project. The project aims to integrate an ESP32 microcontroller and connect it to the AWS cloud for data analytics. The code and resources provided here were created as part of a school project for the Digital Systems course at the Faculty of Science, National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), in collaboration with professors Aldo Vladimir and Rodrigo Castillo.

### Contents

- **aws_mqtt**: This folder contains the final version of the code implemented on the ESP32 microcontroller for establishing the connection to AWS using MQTT protocol.

Please note that discussions and support regarding the code should be directed to ARDUINO and its respective creators.

For more information, please refer to the individual files and folders in this repository.
